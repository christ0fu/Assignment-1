<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my profile. My name is Christopher Mannile, and, at the time of writing, I am a Bachelor of IT student at RMIT university (RMIT, 1887). My student number is s3914392, and my best contact method is my student email: s3914392@student.rmit.edu.au.
I am an Australian citizen and speak only English, as do my parents. I was born in Penrith, NSW, Australia, moved to Western Australia aged four, and lived there until I was 19. I have also lived in Canberra, ACT and Melbourne, Victoria, and spent nearly two years in Aberdeen, UK on a youth mobility visa. I currently live in Midland, Western Australia. My education to date is a Year 12 WACE which was attained from John Tonkin College in Mandurah, Western Australia in 2014. I have one pet, Bongo the cat, and I have attached an image of him for your enjoyment.</p>
<h1>Interests in IT</H1>
<p>Being a millennial, I have grown up with technology like computers and smartphones in my life since birth. I am a creative person and I have always enjoyed applications like RPG editor, various DAWs (sound design tools) and video editing software. Although different in function and purpose, these applications share the ability to act like a blank canvas for you to create whatever you can imagine with, given the time to master them. I do not claim to be a master with these tools, but I do appreciate the sense of exploration and discovery that comes with learning to use them. This has led me to seek more knowledge about IT, the world in which these creationary tools were designed. I want to push the boundaries of code and ultimately be able to use a notepad as a canvas.
I have chosen to pursue higher education at RMIT, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. RMIT’s technology focus has allowed it to be accessible online worldwide, at all hours. For many individuals looking to become students, online university is an intriguing option as it allows students access to material outside of working hours, regardless of their location in the world. RMIT fits with my schedule and is a credible university with great material and features within the website. Factoring in my remote location of Midland with long commute to physical universities, choosing to study with RMIT was an effortless decision.
Throughout my course I am expecting to learn many things. The idea of app design and the potential to create applications – on smartphones or PC – is what I overall intend to be capable of. I will be required to learn multiple programming languages like HTML, python, JavaScript, and this is daunting, given I am not proficient in any at present. Despite this, it’s what I want to explore most in my course. By the end of this course, I want the knowledge to be able to create an application with real world use that any individual can use and interact with.</p>
<h1>My ideal job </h1>

<p>My ideal job would likely be a Mobile App Developer, similar to that in the link found within above screenshot.
<br>
The position of Mobile App Developer requires the employee to be experienced with multiple programming languages (JavaScript, Swift, Objective-C) and be highly competent in an array of IT Industry skills (such as app publication, bug testing, coding). The employee would work with a team of innovative individuals with the overall goal of creating the best user experience within their organisation’s mobile banking app department.
Working with a team of innovative individuals on projects is what I want to do. A workplace that offers the environment to express opinion and encourages intuition is valued highly by myself, and a position like the one mentioned above gives me the impression that this would be a good fit.
To be considered for this application, I would first need to develop multiple skills, both personal and professional. I currently have none of the required industry experience or educational requirements, such as a Bachelor/master’s in engineering (Computer Science or related). To overcome this, I am currently studying for a Bachelor of IT, and aim to learn more about the industry and gain practical experience throughout my journey through university and future careers. I am currently learning HTML and plan to start learning Kotlin after basic HTML capabilities are gained. I already have experience working in teams, acquired through 8+ years working in hospitality, a different industry with teamwork as a transferable skill.</p>
<h1> My profile analysis </h1>
<p> When taking the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator test, my results were type ISFP-A, or personality type “the adventurer”. This suggests I would thrive in a creative and innovative position and that I am adaptable and spontaneous. “The adventurer” personality type is said to be introverted and appreciate their own company, while not necessarily disliking human interaction. A quote from the website: “Few personality types are as colourful and charming as Adventurers”.
When taking the online learning style test found at <a href="https://www.learning-styles-online.com"> https://www.learning-styles-online.com,</a> (learning-styles-online, online Questionare) my results were as follows:<br>
<img src="results learning styles.png" height="250" width="300">
<br>This graph suggests that I would perform well with social and physical learning styles, as well as practical learning. According to the test results, I may struggle with a solidarity style learning and am better suited to a team environment.
When taking the big five personality test () found here –<a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test"> https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test </a>(truity.com, online questionare) – my results returned like this:<br>
<img src="results big 5.png" height="250" width="330"> <br>
The test revolves around 5 key personality traits: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. The individual answers questions about themselves and scores points based off the answers, ultimately equating as a graph and description of your results.
Based on my test results, the graph above indicates that my strongest trait is openness, which suggests I am an abstract thinker and can be creatively minded. My weakest trait as displayed is neuroticism, which implies that I don’t dwell on ideas and can be spontaneous. </p>
<h1>What I have gained from these Tests</h1>
<p> I believe that these tests are not entirely factual, rather educated guesses and generalisations. However, these tests can be beneficial for employers. Assuming that a job applicant answered truthfully, the tests can help to categorise individuals who may share similar tendencies or preferences. Some of the information did resonate with me, and I agree with what some of the tests have proposed as my characteristics.
When working in a team, it has been indicated that I would work well on creative aspects of a project, maybe also in brainstorming phases. I may not be the leader of the group, but I have no trouble taking lead if need be. Perhaps with team members it is important to let them know I don’t rely on strict schedules, so to not incur unrealistic expectations.
If, when forming a team, tests like these are available prior, I would have a bias from now towards people who share similar results as my own. I believe that people who share similar results will associate more fluidly than those with greatly different. This isn’t to say they will not be able to work together, rather that they may have to use greater effort when communicating. </p>
<h1>My project Idea, Thormate</h1>
<P>My project idea is to design an application for mobile devices that sources information from various weather reports to push notifications to the user about the day’s weather forecast, warning users on the likeliness of rain throughout their day. This application will be called Thormate, a combination of the ancient Norse God of storms, Thor, and Mate, to imply the gods are on your side. With Thormate installed, users will receive customisable (daily, hourly) updates through their smartphone device that would notify them if, based on GPS location, the weather in surrounding area was expecting to result in rain hours before this would take place to and how severely. The purpose of this application is to warn users in advance of weather changes, so they may make ample adjustments to their schedule and dress accordingly.</P> <br>
Earth’s weather often seems spontaneous and unpredictable (although meteorologists may disagree with this suggestion). I often am caught off guard by developments in the weather because I have not developed a habit of actively checking the weather forecast. I believe the same can be said for many individuals, and so I seek to design an application that resolves my personal issue. This project aims to notify users hours in advance about the possibility of poor or unappealing weather without actively looking for the information, allowing users to wear appropriate clothing during commutes and saving the user from being caught in the rain.
<p>Thormate aims to automate the user’s knowledge of the weather and better prepare them for daily tasks by utilising push notifications on handheld devices. The application would first be installed on a supported electronic device, ideally through Google play. Once launched, the user is greeted by an interface and welcome screen. After agreeing to terms and conditions, users will input an email account and username; the username will later be displayed within welcome messages and notifications. After account activation, the user can select preferences on which information they prefer be displayed and how often. Variations in notifications could be daily reminders at the same time, for example, set to the same time as alarms to notify users when morning alarms are triggered or just an hour before rain is expected instead. The application will operate in the background of the operating system and, providing the user has GPS location enabled and internet connection, will push notifications to the user. Notifications will provide users with small bits of information regarding how heavy the rain is expected to be, what time it is expected and what temperature it is likely to achieve. The data to make this accurate is gathered via Thormate regularly checking websites for upcoming controversial weather via an API that will be implemented and translating these results as small amounts of information to the user as a notification. The data will be gathered through credible sites and, alternatively, users may choose preferences on where sets of data are gathered. Users will be able to open the application and adjust settings at any time like notification frequency, detail and sources from which the displayed information is gathered. These notifications would display a kind greeting followed by an average temperature for the day as well as highs, lows and if it may rain in their area and an emoticon displaying relative images (Sun, Rain, Ice). An example of this would be ‘Hello <name>, you may want to bring an umbrella today for 3 o’clock’.</p>
The components that will be required to complete this project is relatively low. I will require access to a PC, a code viewing program (Visual studio code, a text writing program (Atom) and an emulator of an android device (Blue stacks).
To learn how develop the code, I will be using free resources like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube.com </a> (youtube.com, Video streaming service) for tutorials and various app development forums. Once the concept is functioning on an emulator, I will then begin testing on physical android devices, and analyse performance among different systems, ultimately making the application compatible on all Android devices version 11 and above.
<p>Thormate will require many different technologies to produce. At my current programming ability level, I will need to discover how to configure the following and intertwine them within code for the application to fulfil its purpose effectively.
<br>
<b>API</b> – Application Programming interface. And API is the process an application will take to communicate and read information from one source, format that information accordingly and send it back to the application that initialised the API. This technology will be used to regularly ping weather forecasts for users and redirecting notifications of upcoming rain.
<br>
<b>Programming language: Kotlin</b> – Kotlin (Kotlin, programming language) is a Programming language that was released to the public in 2016. Kotlin is the default language used when creating an application for Android and is open source.To find out more about Kotlin and how to utilise it, click here <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/"> https://kotlinlang.org/</a></p>
<br>
<b>Android device </b> – An android device can be any hardware able to run an android (android, Smart device operating system) OS. This Is the device that will run Thormate.

<h2> The project conclusion </h2>
<p>On successful completion of this project, I will have resolved my initial problem. With Thormate installed on my phone I will be notified on days when it is expected to rain, giving me knowledge I didn’t know I originally wanted. The project is designed to be free to all users and be used as a tool to improve preparedness for users. This project has the potential to perform other tasks such as show indicators for icy roads or snow forecast, which may be looked at in later stages for implementation. </p>
